# Face Recognition
Face recognition is a pattern recognition task, performed specifically on human faces. The task can be performed easily, repeatedly, and expeditiously by human beings in their everyday life. However, the same task becomes a challenging research problem when performed by machines/algorithms and has received significant attention in the past four decades (1980-2020).

This repositary includes various algorithms for the recogniton of faces in real-world scenarios. The datset used for testing is created at Artificial Intelligence Research Lab, Shaheed Rajguru College, University of Delhi.
